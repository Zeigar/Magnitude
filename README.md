# Magnitude
This is the repository where I am storing the code used to generate behavioural and computational analyses for 2 datasets.

* Behavioural analyses  
Run the *Magnitude_Behavorial_Analyses* script for Experiment 1, Experiment 2, or both.  
The script generates figures.

* Model fitting  
Run the *Magnitude_Model_Fitting* script for Experiment 1 or Experiment 2, for all models.  
The script saves fitted data in specific new .mat files (necessary for model simulation).

* Model simulation  
Run the *Magnitude_Model_Simulation* script for Experiment 1 or Experiment 2, and choose which model.  
The script loads .mat files previously saved and generates figures with data and model simulations.
